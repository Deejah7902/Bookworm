            <h4> In the book,Harvey instructs women on how to be a "keeper" rather than a "sports fish".
                He asserts that men are "simple",and that women should understand that they can never befirst in a man's life
                without understanding and accepting that men are driven by who they are,what they do,and how much they make.
                He says it's "just plain dumb" to let a man lock you in a monmogamous premarital relationship,where you share a bed
                ,bills and even kids.The only way to convert your "committed relationship" into a marrriage is to insist on setting 
                a date for the wedding.
                He writes:
        
                The problem for all too many women who call in to my radio show,though,is that they just can't get that reciprocation 
                from men,women and then end up feeling disappointed,disenfranchised,and disillusioned by their failed relationships in-addition 
                for most failurity of relationship women's are the reason because women can't trust men.
        
            .....I teach them very quickly that expecting a man to respond to them the way a woman would is never going to work.They then realize
            that a clear-eyed,knowing approach to dealing with men on their terms,on their turf, in their way,can,in turn get women exactly what 
            they want.</h4>
